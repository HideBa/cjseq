//! Real-file round trips.
//!
//! Every other test in this crate is synthetic: hand-built JSON literals
//! written from the spec. These are the first tests that put the typed model
//! in front of files nobody wrote for it. The shape matters: a reader
//! compared against another reader's output can agree on the wrong answer
//! (that is exactly how the two bugs motivating this rewrite stayed
//! invisible), but a parse -> serialize -> compare cycle cannot hide a
//! silently dropped member.
//!
//! Comparison is on parsed `serde_json::Value`s, not on strings: several
//! members are backed by `HashMap` and have no stable serialization order, so
//! a byte comparison would fail for reasons that are not data loss. `Value`
//! equality is order-insensitive for object members and exact for everything
//! else, which is the property this test wants.
